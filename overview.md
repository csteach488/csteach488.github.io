#### Overview
This semester long course will offer CS department students a practical introduction to Game Design and
Development. Underlying concepts will be introduced and demonstrated throughout the course with a particular focus
on working examples and playtesting.

Students will gain practical experience of design and development, which is applied as part of the project-based
assessment for the course.

Throughout the course, students will also be exposed to the many and various types of games and gaming
environments now available across multiple genres.

As such, this course will offer a combination of technical concepts and development, awareness of aesthetic
requirements, and cultural perspectives inherently necessary to create well-rounded, performant games and gaming
environments.

#### Outcome
This course has been designed and conceived as an intensive introduction to the world of game design and
development. It should prepare the student for further specific study and work in their chosen gaming domain of
interest.
